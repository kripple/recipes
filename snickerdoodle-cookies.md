# Snickerdoodle Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 1 3/8 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar (for rolling)
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (for rolling)

## Instructions:

1. **Preheat** your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cream of tartar, and cinnamon. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugar**: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

4. **Add egg and vanilla**: Beat in the egg, followed by the vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.

5. **Combine wet and dry ingredients**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.

6. **Make cinnamon-sugar**: In a small bowl, combine the 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.

7. **Roll dough**: Scoop dough into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter). Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until well coated.

8. **Place on baking sheet**: Arrange the coated dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

9. **Bake**: Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden, but the centers are still soft.

10. **Cool**: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a couple of minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your snickerdoodles!
